# Machine Learning Final Project
Given a real tabular data set of 22 features (part of which were known) about E-Commerce site sessions, my partner and I were tasked with classifying whether each session would result in a purchase or not.  
After comparing various models, we selected the one with the highest AUC score and minimal overfitting risk.  
The project contains EDA, pre-processing, feature selection and engineering, modeling and validation.  

The final model (SVM) has reached an AUC score of 90%.
